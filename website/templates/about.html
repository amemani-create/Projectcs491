					<h2>Our Story</h2>
					<p>There’s a blessing behind every challenge, a door of opportunity for each window that
closes, a rainbow after the rain. During one of the most difficult time periods in my life,
out of great despair, a little seed of an idea was born. The seed slowly grew to become
a tiny plant, and Cokedama was born.</p>

	<p> Back in 2019, having resigned from a secure permanent job and after starting my own
private practice as a charted architecture to be a better mom to my beautiful two babies,
I’ve struggled to find work. As a stay-at-home parent earning half of her previous
income, and juggling work and home life, taking care of two young kids, I found myself
at a low point in no time. I was disappointed with myself and life. One day a friend
visiting noticed a plant of Orchid at my house and she was asking me if i grow Orchids.
At this time, I haven’t even planted anything on my own, the orchid plant wasn’t even
mine as it was a gift from my mother-in-law. I knew nothing about gardening nor
planstscaping. However, my husband overheard the conversation between me and my
friend and he suggested why don’t you learn about growing orchids as you have some
free time at your hands now.</p>

	<p> I went for training on growing orchids, anthuriums, and ornamental plants. This
suddenly sparked a fire inside me to learn more and more about these subjects, me and
my husband and I both kept learning, researching and growing plants. When I
discovered this old-turned-new technique called Kokedama for displaying houseplants,
my life changed overnight. We even bought a little land plot away from the city in a
beautiful area called Balangoda, to grow plants. The very first time we visited our newly
bought land, I spotted some snake plants that were plucked and were just lying there
and I brought them home. I made my first Kokedama plant ball from that snake plant
and I still have it with me. So that was the beginning of Cokedama Interior
Plantscaping. In the times of lockdowns and travel restrictions in the years 2020 - 2021,
I kept doing my research and growing and experimenting with my plants. I was very
grateful I had found this to keep me busy during these troubled times.</p>

	<p> Since I was immensely inspired by this plant media, I used the same research for my
dissertation submission to become a charted landscape architect. </p>

	<p> Something I’ve experienced as a child with my mother, and me as a mom, and also
among many of my friends is that there are lots of well-educated women in our society
that find themselves without much inspiration and financial freedom while taking care of
their children and families. These women represent a large portion of our society and
these are the people that can do creative, meaningful work to support their families,
financially while having a stable income that empowers them to feel important
regardless of the fact that they are staying home looking after the kids. So with my
business, I want to support these women, I want to empower moms, and create a
platform for them to learn, find inspiration, and sell their creations.</p>

	<p> Right now, I’m very excited and hopeful about my little business and I will carry on
making beautiful cute plants not only that bring you joy but also makes a difference in
many other lives. Now I know that sometimes, what seems to be bitter trials in life, turns
into blessings in disguise. I wish my story inspire you too.</p>
